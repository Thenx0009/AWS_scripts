LOAD BALANCER

A load balancer is a critical component of modern web applications and services that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or instances to ensure hidh availability,reliabilty ans sacalability. Load balancers play a crucial role in optimizing resource utilization and ensuring that no single server becomes overloaded,thus improving the performance.

Types of Load Balancers:

1) Application Load balancer(ALBs)

 ->ALBs operate at the application layer of the OSi Model

 ->ALBS are commonly used for web applications,APIs and
   microservices.

2) Network Load Balancer(NLBs)

  ->NLBs operate at the transport layer of the OSi Model and
    design for handling TCP and UDP traffic.

  ->They provide high throughput,low-latency load balancing and     
    are used for sceneraios that require high network 
    performance.

3) Classic Load Balance(CLBs)

  ->CLBs are the older generation of AWS load balancers both HTTP
    /HTTPS and TCP/UDP traffic.
  
  -> They are suitable for basic load balancing needs but lack 
     some advanced features present in ALBs and NLBs.

4) Gateway Load Balancer

  ->It is an AWS service that allows you to deploy a centralized 
    load balancer to manage and distribute traffic acrossmultiple
    virtual private clouds (VPCs) and VPN connection.

  ->making it easier to sacle and secure your applications across 
    different network environments.

Use Cases and Benefits of Load Balancers:

1)High Availability
2)Scalability
3)Improved Performance
4)SSl/TLS Terminations
5)Session persistence
