**LOAD BALANCER** The growth in the number of active users inevitably leads to an increase in the load on the servers. To ensure good UX it is necessary to properly balance the load. This is why the use of load balancer is important â€“ it distributes network or application traffic between multiple servers in a server pool. Each load balancer resides between client devices and back-end servers, receiving and distributing incoming requests to any available server capable of fulfilling them.
